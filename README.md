# Donut.c

## Introduction

​	Back to 2006, there's a interesting c project on the internet called Donut.c, which can print the ascii characters in the terminal of a rotating donut. And recently it is widely spread and discussed through the internet, and after we looko into the source code, we find out that the whole algorithm is based on what we have learned in Vv214. From here, we want to do some deep research and expand this project based on the current one.

## Concepts

Here we list some of the usful concept of linear algebra to help us print the rotating donut on the terminal.

1. Rotation Matrix in 3 dimensional space.

2. Orthogonality : produce normal vector from a surface.

3. Inner product : dot product of normal vector and light vector to get the brightness.

4. Projection : to produce 2d animation from 3d space.
5. Discrete Dynamic System : Frame by frame are generated.

## 	Goal

​	To get the total understanding of the whole concept, and from here, we can modify if to generate different kind of animation. For example, we can change the shape, the size, the rotating speed, or even the dimension of the object.

## Reminder

​	Due to the `gif` in the presentation slides, please only use **adobe acrobat** to open the pdf, in this way it can work properly as it should be.


## About Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the SJTU student handbook (2019 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.
