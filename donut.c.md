# Donut.c

## 	Back to 2006, there's a interesting c project on the internet called Donut.c, which can print the ascii characters in the terminal of a rotating donut. And recently it is widely spread and discussed through the internet, and after we looko into the source code, we find out that the whole algorithm is based on what we have learned in Vv214. From here, we want to do some deep research and expand this project based on the current one.

## 	Here we list some of the usful concept of linear algebra to help us print the rotating donut on the terminal.

### 1. Rotation Matrix in 3 dimensional space.

### 2. Orthogonality : produce normal vector from a surface.

### 3. Inner product : dot product of normal vector and light vector to get the brightness.

### 4. Projection : to produce 2d animation from 3d space.

## 	Goal : To get the total understanding of the whole concept, and from here, we can modify if to generate different kind of animation. For example, we can change the shape, the size, the rotating speed, or even the dimension of the object.
